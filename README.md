API:
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data. It acts as an intermediary, enabling developers to access specific functionalities or data from external systems without exposing internal details.
SDK:
An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples that developers use to build applications for a specific platform or framework. It simplifies the development process by providing prebuilt components and utilities tailored to the target system.
WEB APIs:
Web APIs are interfaces that enable communication between web applications and servers, allowing them to exchange data using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. They are commonly used to access functionalities or data from web-based services, such as retrieving user information or integrating third-party services.
LIBRARY APIs: 
Library APIs are interfaces provided by software libraries that allow developers to interact with predefined functions and features within the library. They simplify application development by offering reusable code for specific tasks, such as data processing or graphical rendering.
PROMPTING:
This is the input phase where a user provides an instruction or query to the LLM. The prompt guides the model on the desired task, which could range from answering a question to generating text in a specific style. Effective prompting is crucial, as it directly influences the quality and relevance of the model's output. Crafting clear and specific prompts helps the LLM understand the user's intent and produce appropriate responses.
COMPLETION:
This is the output phase where the LLM generates a response based on the given prompt. The completion is the model's attempt to fulfill the user's request, whether by providing information, creating content, or performing a specified task. The quality of the completion depends on factors like the prompt's clarity and the model's training data.
